        "content":"It was a tough time due to the pandemic. People had a hard time finding a  job and had to go to the first job they got selected. However, completing the  BSc MIT was truly a blessing as we could apply for both IT and Management.  Following MIT, playing basketball and taekwondo, vice captaining a team,  holding positions in clubs and societies and working with them helped  develop my “never giving up” attitude."
